# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project I utilize an extended kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Root mean squared error (RMSE) values are under 0.11 for x and y positions and under 0.56 for vx and vy.

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

See `Dataset 1.mov` and `Dataset 2.mov` in this repo for two sample videos.
